Description: CrossTx is a comprehensive R package designed for cross-species
  transcriptomic similarity analysis between human cancer and clinical
  mouse models. It implements standardized pipelines for DEG analysis, homolog
  gene conversion, PCA, immune infiltration, GO enrichment, and similarity
  scoring. With built-in data formatting and flexible visualization functions,
  CrossTx enables reproducible and scalable evaluation of murine models that
  best mimic human disease transcriptional profiles, facilitating rational
  model selection in translational research.
